# HydrogenEngine
An OpenGL rendering engine written in C++ and GLSL

I plan to do heavy restructuring with this engine soon. Basically I need to move a lot of stuff to makefiles and add all dependencies to the the vendor folder. Also I need to throw out a bunch of libraries I don't use like expat and libxslt
