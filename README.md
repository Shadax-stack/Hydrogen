# HydrogenEngine
An OpenGL rendering engine written in C++ and GLSL

I plan to do heavy restructuring with this engine soon.
Here is what I would do:
Game engine
| - HydrogenRenderer
| - Some Physics engine (Maybe in a few months because I have no idea how rigid bodies work)
| - Somd sound library (Probably will never happen)
| - Some scripting library (maybe part of the engine itself)
Most of these libraries would rely on some basic math library, loading library, and basic utility library 
I will also use CMake for the project
